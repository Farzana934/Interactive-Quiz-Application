*DESCRIPTON*:
This project is a simple and interactive quiz application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, a popular and powerful code editor. The quiz allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback on their answers, and view their final score at the end. The goal of this project is to help users test their knowledge in a fun and easy-to-use format while also demonstrating core web development skills.

The main tools used in this project are HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for functionality. HTML helps create the basic layout of the quiz, such as the question area, answer buttons, and score section. CSS is used to make the quiz look nice and professional by adding colors, spacing, fonts, and hover effects. JavaScript brings the quiz to life by loading questions, checking answers, keeping track of scores, and updating the display dynamically as the user interacts with it.

The quiz works by loading one question at a time. Each question has four possible answers. When a user clicks on an answer, the app shows right away whether it was correct or not by changing the button color—green for correct, red for wrong. The user can then click the “Next Question” button to continue. After all questions have been answered, the app shows the user’s total score and gives the option to restart the quiz and try again.

The app contains 10 questions on different topics like science, history, general knowledge, and technology. All the questions are stored in a JavaScript array, and the app uses loops and event listeners to display them one by one. The design is clean and mobile-friendly, meaning it looks good on both computers and smartphones. A custom font from Google Fonts was used to make the text easier to read and more modern.

This type of quiz application can be useful in many areas. For example, it can be used in schools and colleges to help students practice, in **training sessions** for employees, or just for fun as a trivia game. It can also be improved by adding more features like a countdown timer, a progress bar, different quiz categories, or even questions loaded from an API or database.

The project was built entirely on the frontend, meaning it does not require a server or database to run. It can be hosted easily on websites like **GitHub Pages**, Netlify, or Vercel for free. This makes it a great beginner project to learn and practice web development skills.

In conclusion, this quiz app is a great way to understand the basics of building a web application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows how to structure a web page, style it nicely, and make it interactive using JavaScript. It is simple to use, looks good, and can be expanded with many new features in the future. It’s also a great addition to any developer’s portfolio.
